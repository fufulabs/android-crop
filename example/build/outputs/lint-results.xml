        id="OldTargetApi"
        severity="Warning"
        message="Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details."
        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Checks that the manifest specifies a targetSdkVersion that is recent"
        explanation="When your application runs on a version of Android that is more recent than your `targetSdkVersion` specifies that it has been tested with, various compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the `targetSdkVersion` is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the UI.

To fix this issue, set the `targetSdkVersion` to the highest available value. Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version you are adding support for: http://developer.android.com/reference/android/os/Build.VERSION_CODES.html"

        severity="Warning"
        message="Attribute &quot;showAsAction&quot; is only used in API level 11 and higher (current min is 9)"
        category="Correctness"
        priority="6"
        summary="Finds usages of attributes that will not be used (read) on all targeted versions"
        explanation="This check finds attributes set in XML files that were introduced in a version newer than the oldest version targeted by your application (with the the `minSdkVersion` attribute).

This is not an error; the application will simply ignore the attribute. However, if the attribute is important to the appearance of functionality of your application, you should consider finding an alternative way to achieve the same result with only available attributes, and then you can optionally create a copy of the layout in a layout-vNN folder which will be used on API NN or higher where you can take advantage of the newer attribute."

        priority="4"
        summary="Checks whether a root &lt;FrameLayout> can be replaced with a `&lt;merge>` tag"
        explanation="If a `&lt;FrameLayout>` is the root of a layout and does not provide background or padding etc, it can often be replaced with a `&lt;merge>` tag which is slightly more efficient. Note that this depends on context, so make sure you understand how the `&lt;merge>` tag works before proceeding."

Low density is not really used much anymore, so this check ignores the ldpi density. To force lint to include it, set the environment variable `ANDROID_LINT_INCLUDE_LDPI=true`. For more information on current density usage, see http://developer.android.com/resources/dashboard/screens.html"

        severity="Warning"
        message="[Accessibility] Missing contentDescription attribute on image"
        category="Accessibility"
        priority="3"
        summary="Ensures that image widgets provide a contentDescription"
        explanation="Non-textual widgets like ImageViews and ImageButtons should use the `contentDescription` attribute to specify a textual description of the widget such that screen readers and other accessibility tools can adequately describe the user interface.

Note that elements in application screens that are purely decorative and do not provide any content or enable a user action should not have accessibility content descriptions. In this case, just suppress the lint warning with a tools:ignore=&quot;ContentDescription&quot; attribute.

Note that for text fields, you should not set both the `hint` and the `contentDescription` attributes since the hint will never be shown. Just set the `hint`. See http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/accessibility/checklist.html#special-cases."
